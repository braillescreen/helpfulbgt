# Helpful
Please be aware: This project is considered abandonware. I don't code hardly at all in BGT anymore, and will not be updating this codebase much anymore accept to fix some errors and such. I will still be looking out for PR's or issues, but the project itself is no longer under active development.

## What is this?
This is a helpful set of scripts that I made that might help you do things a bit easier. An explanation of everything in here is below.

Please note that you must have the Blastbay Gaming Toolkit (BGT) engine to run these scripts.

### Basic Assignment Templet:
Simple way to make basic school assignments.

Includes a few versions (Version 1 to the current version 6) with code changes and improvements in each.

Clearly commented

### Clipboard Tools
This simply allows you to read or write text to you're clipboard.

Not clearly commented, but it should be simple enough to learn.

### Copyright
This is a copyright function. More info can be found in the code.

Commented to an extent. The comments explain what it does and how to use it (Including a test.bgt script).

### Directory Lister:
This program allows you to find all files in a directory.

You enter what you want to find into the input box that comes up, and you get what it finds.

It has no error checks, you could add them on you're own if you need to.

### Logger:
Logger is designed to allow you to quickly log anything happening that you wish to log.

The logger is commented, so you know how to use it.

### Process Killer:
This is a program that allows you to kill a running process. It does not require the extension (.exe). So type a process name, like bgt or TeamTalk5Classic to kill that process.

Is not commented.

### Profile Example.
The profiler is designed to tell you how long a method has run while your script is running. This is a simple example on how to use it.

### Random Number Generator:
This is three scripts designed to generate random number's.

* RandomNumber.bgt just generates a random number and alerts it, asking if you would like to copy it to the clipboard.

* The second BGT script allows you to choose the minimum and maximum, and also adds an error function as an example.

* The third one is one I made for an old school project. It asks you for your name, and then generates another number. This is kind of more advanced, and is not commented at all.

### Savedata Example:

This was requested by Ty. Savedata is a class that Masonasons.me made that allows you to save settings in a file that you can use in anything you want, and this was a quick example I attempted to make.

### String Reverser:

This is a simple program that allows you to reverse strings of text that it asks you for.

## How did this come to be?

Well, I needed some basic little scripts that would let me do things quicker, or I was board and wanted to code something, or sometimes people wanted me to code something simple for them. This is a growing collection of these small projects, and this may be updated in the future as new scripts get added.

## See Also
[GlobalBGT](https://github.com/braillescreen/globalbgt) is a global BGT script you can include that allows for some most used includes to be in one place such as readable time and date and time.
